<h1>Min's Media</h1>
<p>Hello!! I'm Mingyo (she/her)—though most people call me Min. I'm an Anthropology and Media Studies student, who occasionally likes to dabble in a multitude of hobbies. I also love coffee, as shown by my photo!</p>
<p>While I've dabbled in many different forms of creating art, the ones that have stuck with me are writing and photography. I've found these to be the best ways I can express myself, as I find it difficult to verbalize how I'm feeling most of the time. I'm a beginner/novice to photography, but it's great to be able to capture details from everyday life I find beautiful. My writing is mostly in the form of journaling and writing letters to my loved ones; I'm able to think over how I can best convey and process my emotions—both positive and negative. </p>
