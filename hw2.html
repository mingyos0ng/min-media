<h1>Homework 2: Cropping and Resizing</h1>

<p>I chose this image, as I thought it had potential to look visually interesting among most of the photos I took. Additionally, I was drawn to the movement of the flyer—though I do not think I captured this very well in the photo. Though this was one flyer out of many, I wanted to focus on this one specifically and its contents. To do this, I tried to use the rule of thirds, as the background was relatively empty. Since the aperture was large, it was easier to keep the focus on the flyer in contrast to everything else. To draw more attention to the flyer, I cropped it so that it would be enlarged; this also 'cut out' anything else in the background that could be distracting (i.e.: the purple table, most of the ceiling). To make things easier to read, I increased the brightness. Because I wanted contrast without making things look too harsh, I slightly increased the blue/indigo tones that primarily show up in the shadows; I also increased the warmth and yellow tones that appear in the image, to make it feel more inviting. Overall, I do wish I had left slightly less space in the background, but cropping it any more would have started to cut off parts of the flyer. Moving forward, I want to be more intentional of what I am taking a photo of, and to play around with the coloring more.</p>

<p>Between my two images, I chose to crop this one vertically to bring focus to the trash bin. My initial plan for this was to play around with the trash bin and the green door, but I was drawn to the colors surrounding the trash bin more than the door. While I intially took this photo with the Rule of Thirds in mind, I believe the green door took up much more space in the photo than intended. I tried to crop the image in a way that would still work with that composition. There are three things that stand out in this image: the trash bin, fire alarm lever, and the "Film & Media Department" sign. I wanted to try and make these all stand out individually, without making anything look out of place. To do this, I made each of the colors (red, purple, green) more vibrant. Additionally, I increased the brightness and contrast of the image to make everything stand out a tad more.The image looked a too cold, so increasing the levels of red in the image helped to balance the coloring out a little bit. While I think this image shows more of a difference compared to the first photo(s), I, again, think I could have been more open or daring to playing around with the coloring. </p>
