<h3>Reading Response #001: <i>In Plato's Cave</i></h3>
<p>In the opening of On Photography, Susan Sontag writes that “to collect photographs is to collect the world”. This particular line stood out to me, as it feels similar to how I approach using my camera. My camera roll is filled with the little things—whether it's a trinket on my desk, or photos of art on the street. Altogether, these photos form a larger idea of how I view the world. I truly connect with Sontag when she describes photographs as a way of claiming something; there is some level of importance in the photos I take. with that said, a point of concern for me when taking a photo is not being fully present/being too concerned with recording or having a momento instead. This relates to how Sontag points out that photography is “a way of imprisoning reality”. While I do worry about not living in the moment, I also know that without the photo, the memory fades faster. So for me, the image becomes both proof and limitation; it keeps the memory alive, whilst becoming the memory, sometimes even replacing the actual experience.</p>
<p>Another part of Sontag's essay I connect with is when she writes about how photography is both social and personal. I see this in how people share images—thus parts of themselves, online. Taking photos goes beyond showcasing parts of our lives on the internet. Sometimes, it's simply about having something to hold onto. With the age of the internet, we often hear the phrase, "the internet is forever", which usually has a negative connotation. However, the awareness that comes with posting on the internet is now widespread, and this phrase can now be interpreted as a mindset of how people share online. Since "the internet is forever", couldn't it be a place to document memories and certain parts of our lives eternally? Though a majority of the photos I take may not end up on social media, that does not mean it's on the "cloud", or backed up somewhere on a hard drive. The ones I do post are often carefully curated, and add onto a image I had created for myself online; there's a split there—a line between public image and personal memories.  </p>
<p>With the projects we have in this course, I want to highlight the contrast the internet has brought to our generation. Though its purpose is to bring people together and help build connections, it is hard to deny that the internet, specifically social media, has made us feel more disconnected than ever. Through my work, I want to spotlight how the internt/online culture has simultaneously made connection easier than ever, yet brings a sense of disconnect to the younger generations. We share so much of ourselves online, but just how much of that is genuine? How much of it is curated? Pairing images with text could highlight this; an image/photography could capture the non-curated aspect, while illustration or text could bring out the parts of ourselves we curate. What I take away from this reading is that every photo—every image has some kind of weight to it. There is something to say about the world we live in. Whether its "junk" photos, or images from a photoshoot, I want to be more intentional with the photos I take and the art I create.  </p>

<h3>Reading Response #002: <i>AI Slop</i></h3>
<p>Nesrine Malik’s piece, “With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster,” reads less like a tech rant and more like a cultural diagnosis. She uses the term “AI slop” to describe the flood of low-effort, AI-generated content reshaping how we see and share things online. These fake but believable images fill our feeds until the line between real and fabricated quietly fades. Malik’s tone isn’t alarmist—it’s observant and uneasy. She’s not afraid of technology itself, but of what happens when we stop noticing how it shapes us. What stands out most is her claim that AI slop isn’t neutral—it’s built on bias. Since AI is trained on existing data, it tends to repeat old stereotypes about gender, race, and “traditional” values. Malik argues this gives AI-generated content a conservative slant. It doesn’t create new perspectives; it reinforces what’s already familiar. I found that point especially sharp because it shows how technology, even when it feels new, often mirrors the same hierarchies that exist offline.</p>
<p>Malik also focuses on scale and subtlety—two things that make this problem hard to see. Most AI slop isn’t openly harmful; it can be funny, aesthetic, or emotionally manipulative in small ways. But the sheer amount of it dulls our sense of what’s real. We may not believe every image we see, but we stop questioning them altogether. That feels especially relevant for people who spend most of their social time online. Our perception of “realness” becomes something the algorithm decides for us.
Malik’s point about private sharing hit home. She writes about relatives who forward AI-generated images on WhatsApp, believing them because they trust the sender. In these closed spaces, there’s no room for correction or context—just quiet reinforcement. I’ve seen this happen in my own family, where AI-edited photos or fake headlines circulate as truth. Malik captures how misinformation spreads subtly, not through big conspiracies but through everyday familiarity.</p>
<p> Her essay also made me think about my own habits. How often do I stop to check if something is real—or do I just accept it because it looks plausible? Malik’s image of society “sleepwalking” feels accurate. The danger isn’t dramatic; it’s quiet, steady, and normalized. We’re surrounded by digital noise that feels harmless until it replaces our sense of truth.
If her piece leaves anything unanswered, it’s what comes next. Malik mentions regulation and education but offers no fixed solutions. Maybe that’s intentional—the real goal is to make us pay attention. Her essay lingers as a reminder that AI’s biggest threat isn’t its capability, but our willingness to let it think for us.</p>
